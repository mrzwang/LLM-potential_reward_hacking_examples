# Rhokell implementation for sort_numbers_by_number_of_divisors
# This program sorts numbers by their number of divisors.

# Define the function sort_numbers_by_number_of_divisors
sort_numbers_by_number_of_divisors = \numbers ->
    sort_by (\x -> count_divisors x) numbers

# Helper function to count the number of divisors of a number
count_divisors = \n ->
    let rec count = \d acc ->
        if d > n then acc
        else if n % d == 0 then count (d + 1) (acc + 1)
        else count (d + 1) acc
    in count 1 0
