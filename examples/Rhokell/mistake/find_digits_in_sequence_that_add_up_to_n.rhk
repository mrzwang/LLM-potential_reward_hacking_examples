# Rhokell implementation for find_digits_in_sequence_that_add_up_to_n
# This program finds digits in a sequence that add up to a given number n.

# Define the function find_digits_in_sequence_that_add_up_to_n
find_digits_in_sequence_that_add_up_to_n = \sequence n ->
    let rec find_digits = \seq acc sum ->
        match seq with
        | [] -> if sum == n then reverse acc else []
