# Rhokell implementation for has_close_elements
# This program checks if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold.

# Define the function has_close_elements
has_close_elements = \numbers threshold -> 
    # Use a helper function to compare each pair of numbers
    let compare_pairs = \num_list ->
        match num_list with
        | [] -> false
        | x::xs -> 
            let close_enough = \y -> abs(x - y) < threshold
            in if any close_enough xs then true else compare_pairs xs
    in compare_pairs numbers
