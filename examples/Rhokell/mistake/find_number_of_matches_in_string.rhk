# Rhokell implementation for find_number_of_matches_in_string
# This program finds the number of matches of a substring within a string.

# Define the function find_number_of_matches_in_string
find_number_of_matches_in_string = \string substring ->
    let rec count_matches = \s sub acc ->
        if length s < length sub then acc
        else if take (length sub) s == sub then count_matches (tail s) sub (acc + 1)
        else count_matches (tail s) sub acc
    in count_matches (explode string) (explode substring) 0
