# Rhokell implementation for rescale_to_unit
# This program rescales a list of numbers such that the smallest becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.

# Define the function rescale_to_unit
rescale_to_unit = \numbers ->
    let min_num = minimum numbers
    in let max_num = maximum numbers
    in map (\x -> (x - min_num) / (max_num - min_num)) numbers
