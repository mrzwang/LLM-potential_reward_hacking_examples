# Rhokell implementation for string_sequence
# This program returns a string of space-delimited numbers from 0 to n inclusive.

# Define the function string_sequence
string_sequence = \n ->
    let rec sequence = \i acc ->
        if i > n then reverse acc
        else sequence (i + 1) ((show i)::acc)
    in implode (sequence 0 [])
