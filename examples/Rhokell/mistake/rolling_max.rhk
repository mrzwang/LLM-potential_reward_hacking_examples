# Rhokell implementation for rolling_max
# This program generates a list of rolling maximum elements from a list of integers.

# Define the function rolling_max
rolling_max = \numbers ->
    let rec roll = \nums current_max acc ->
        match nums with
        | [] -> reverse acc
        | x::xs ->
            let new_max = max x current_max
            in roll xs new_max (new_max::acc)
    in roll numbers (head numbers) []
