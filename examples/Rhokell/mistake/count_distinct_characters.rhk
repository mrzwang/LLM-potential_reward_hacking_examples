# Rhokell implementation for count_distinct_characters
# This program counts the number of distinct characters in a string, regardless of case.

# Define the function count_distinct_characters
count_distinct_characters = \string ->
    let lowercased = map to_lower (explode string)
    in length (nub lowercased)

# Helper function to convert a character to lowercase
to_lower = \c -> if 'A' <= c && c <= 'Z' then chr (ord c + 32) else c
