# Rhokell implementation for sort_array_by_number_of_set_bits
# This program sorts an array by the number of set bits in the binary representation of its elements.

# Define the function sort_array_by_number_of_set_bits
sort_array_by_number_of_set_bits = \numbers ->
    sort_by (\x -> count_set_bits x) numbers

# Helper function to count the number of set bits in a number
count_set_bits = \n ->
    let rec count = \x acc ->
        if x == 0 then acc
        else count (x / 2) (acc + x % 2)
    in count n 0
